I am lazy. I am inefficient. I am not intelligent(as per education standards). Today I am writing because I guess i am very lazy, and I don't work hard for my education and now I kind of know why. The reason is **REASON**. `WHY?` WHY SHOULD I?. Well the reason is reason. I have seen people studying and working hard to find a job. Thats good. Finding a job is important, because you need to help yourself before you could help others.

I on the other hand don't know why am I studying. Well I like studying(not textbooks). My kind of study is like always getting to understand the things I interact with my daily life. Thats what makes me lazy. I never like studying to get a job or study to get admission but the system forces me to do it that way. Although it is a good system because one need to be smart enough to solve problem after acquiring knowledge. The same system played with me 4 years back and its back again me. I guess it again is time to change.

I would really like to be a student my entire life getting to know everything.The best part of knowledge is sharing and helping others. I would like to help as many people I can, but the stupid idea of being able to crack question in a time frame isn't my cup of tea. I kind of like to take my time understand dive deep and come with the same result. Maybe I am slow but never can I leave a topic without diving deep and diving does take time. To add to this is my patience, I guess thats the only thing I am very good with. Like i keep waiting waiting and I too think sometimes it beyond certain limits. Thats how I work. So I always keep my head up for the next good thing to happen and keep doing what I like. I know what I do is maybe useless, but mind you everything you do counts and will surely pay you some day. The result will be positive but it may come late. I know I may not dig deep with the result part but I will quench my thirst and I will feel satisfied

So the key to success I think is the driving force.
>The force that push a mother to give away her life for the child. The force that makes a lover swim oceans. You just need the force, results don't matter to that kind of force.
