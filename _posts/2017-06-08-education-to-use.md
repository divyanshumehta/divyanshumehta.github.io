It is often said that education is not merely reading textbooks and writing exams rather it is a way to enable one to learn about something and use that knowledge to improve it. The the tedious task of learning is not easy. Children often are forced to learn and study things which they don't like and this encourages them to hate the word education and school. I would say school is not a place where you sit in a class listen to teachers lectures, write notes, study hard to get good grades, rather it is should be a place where to are encouraged to learn what you desire and in ways that focus on learning by doing. According to me the best way to learn something is to get your hands dirty with the content. First you get curious about the content then you explore the content then experiment and of course when one experiments he fails. This failure is the most important thing in life, because it triggers thinking. Why did I fail? This question then paves the way for the answer. The answer helps to devise a new procedure for the experiment. The experiment may again fail but the man does not stop. This fail and think cycle repeats until you get the right answer. When this answer is achieved the man now does not to memorize it. Since he fails he know what mistakes he did and remember is for the next time. Name is human nature but it is genetic which has evolved in us that we only remember things that we do wrong.

I feel great today because I too failed an experiment no casualties though . What I did today was realted to something computer scienttists and student would call "Concurrent file access". Well I read this a few months. Learnt about Semaphores called mutex and readcount. At that time I understood what it, but the good thing happened today.

Well I was trying to record a DVD audio into MP3 format (RIP MP3) . I turned on VLC player and started to record the DVD. Also I wanted to listen to the songs concurrently. Now I knew that files could be read concurrently but not written concurrently. So I thought for a while and played the DVD through another VLC window. The moment VLC player started to play the DVD, I heard sounds from the DVD drive tray, something as if it was being restrained from spinning.

Hearing the sound the closed the new VLC windows and the sound stopped. `**Why did it sound like that?**`

I thought and finally got my answer a CD/DVD optical drive does not have separated read and write head and so a neither concurrent reading nor concurrent wrting is possible in case of a CD/DVD media.

This is something I found on my own and this I will remember of a lifetime is this called education, and I was haapy when i thought about it over that how those useless sounding lectures helped me tackle a new challenge that I faced.
