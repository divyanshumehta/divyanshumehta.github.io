First of of honestly I didn't except to write my blogs so often, we but I could not restrain myself from it too, because its the Sparrow.. Ahh sorry **Captain Jack Spparow** . Now that the movie is official released I could wait to watch it. The entire series is a comic action thriller, where the comic is single handedly taken care of by Johnny Deep and a Monkee. I still remember the first time I watched the movie "Curse of The Black Pearl" it was a great movie and since then I became a fan of the series. The sequels that followed ever even better the mysteries revolving around something called as 'Kraken' which is also a true rumor among large masses on Earth, and not to mention the wretched crew of the Flying Dutchman and their captain Davy Jones. The level of art that is potrayed in making a underwater crew with people shaped as sharks and octopus and other deep sea creatures.

The movie series also keep East India Trading Company involved all along as an empire that wants to rule to sea to benefit its business and hence wants to get rid of the pirates. This is another factor that keeps me loving the series, as I love reading and knowing the history and East India Trading Company is related to my history.

All in all the whole series is a great fun to watch, it involves various adventures and acts of bravery, intelligence, comic, thrill and much more. Thank you for such a series made my life awesome. **PIRATES' LIFE**
